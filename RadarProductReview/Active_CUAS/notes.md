### Qinetiq (UK)
#### [Obsidian](https://www.qinetiq.com/en/what-we-do/services-and-products/counter-drone-systems) Counter Drone System
Obsidian utilises a purpose-designed 3D staring radar, proving both high accuracy 3D position information, a high update rate (0.5s) and low minimum target speed (0.5m/s) – unlike scanning radars which can take several seconds to update. This high-performance radar can detect aerial threats from as much as 3.5km away – whether that’s in the horizontal plane or directly above, meaning threats can be detected and identified earlier, providing valuable additional time to react to the potential attack.

Obsidian’s detection capability isn’t limited to just one aerial threat. In fact, Obsidian can simultaneously detect and track multiple aerial threats. And where line of sight to the ground is available, ground-based movement can be detected as well. The various threats can be identified by their individual signatures, enabling early identification of concerted swarm and ground-based strikes.

As soon as a threat is detected Obsidian continuously monitors its location, setting on a high resolution day/night camera for visual confirmation. The use of ‘micro-Doppler’ radar techniques to detect drone rotor blades and Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to the camera image also provide high confidence of the nature of the threat, minimising false alarms and maintaining business/mission continuity.

Obsidian’s highly accurate and timely 3D position updates uniquely allow rapid set-on of drone defeat options, allowing them to be precisely targeted, whilst maximising safe operation. QinetiQ’s approach allows us to work with our customers and partners to provide a range of services and solutions to mission-critical operational requirements.
