# My Questions
## Why 8MHz sampling rate allow 8MHz bandwidth?
As it is superheterodyne downconversion, it is sampling 2x every sampling period thus complex nyqust is satisfied.
## ADC sample rate is 200MS/s but Max Instantateous Bandwidth is 160MHz?

## Exactly why do we need 200MS/s / 24 - decimation of adc? 
## How does USRP sample two channels with one ADC, as shown in the block diagram?

## Bisatic angle reduces range resolution?
